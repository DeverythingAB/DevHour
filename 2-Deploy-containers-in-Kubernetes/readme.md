2: Deploy containers in Kubernetes
In this section we will package the microservices we have from section 1 into docker containers. Then we will show you how to deploy them into your local Kubernetes setup. To make this more fun we will also deploy them into AWS EKS (Managed Kubernetes service in Amazon)

Completing this section will get you familiar with docker and Kubernetes and how you can get them into a cloud provider.

#kubernetes, #docker, #aws, #EKS
