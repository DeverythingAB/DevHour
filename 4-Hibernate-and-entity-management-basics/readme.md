# 4: Hibernate and entity management basics
In this session we will add Hibernate and Spring Data. We will go through the entity manager and what role it plays and also learn how to map relations between your entities (One to One, One to Many, Many to One, Many to Many). We will also add some unit tests.

Completing this section will give you an idea of how to prepare your project for using databases and how to query them.
